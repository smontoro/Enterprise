<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<img class="wp-image-1099 size-large alignright" style="width: 50%;" src="http://enterpriseforyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/About-Us-Picture-1024x682.jpg" alt="About Enterprise for Youth" width="710" height="473">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise for Youth empowers young people to prepare for and discover career opportunities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Youth cultivate their individual interests and potential through training, guidance, and employment experiences in supportive and diverse environments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise youth build confidence and skills through workshops, one-on-one guidance, and career exploration. Then they put those new skills into practice through employment and internships.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Learning in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment, Enterprise for Youth members gain more than valuable skills and training. They acquire confidence. They build trusting relationships with supportive adults and they serve as role models for their peers.</p>

<blockquote><cite>“For low income youth, early access to economic opportunity is critical- 43% of Americans raised at the bottom of the income ladder remain stuck there as adults… By 2025 sixty-five percent of the jobs in the United States will require some postsecondary education, training or credential- up from 28% in the 1970s. These heightened expectations mean that it’s more essential than ever for young people to gain work experience and skills today to enable them to compete in the global workforce in the future.”</cite>
